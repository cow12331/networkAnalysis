@danielptucker - @jozacks Cool. I can't make it tomorrow, but I'll try to make it to the next Vassar in Tech.
@danielptucker - @jozacks Anything interesting at Vassar in Tech? Are there a lot of people in attendance? Didn't even know about it.
@danielptucker - @jozacks Lathrop for two years. Then the TAs. Seems like forever ago. Do you ever go to any Vassar Club of NYC events? I haven't been.
@danielptucker - @jozacks 2004
@danielptucker - @jozacks I guess the good thing is that AOL dropped the plan after the kerfuffle. What year were you at Vassar? You look familiar!
