@manoushz - RT @pmjim: #Wearablesolar firm has solar engineer & fashion designer working on clothes that charge phone #sxswaccel http://t.co/bv9gGv1Yp4
@manoushz - I work as hard as I do b/c I'm afraid of 24 yr-olds says @mat ; nice to know it's not just the ladies who worry #onlinedads
@manoushz - Tech journos (@mat @ClaraJeffery @alexismadrigal) get personal about parenting at #onlinedads panel. #sxsw http://t.co/zigQdlIBxA
@manoushz - @webjournalist ha! Totally! Surprised you don't have more Glass comrades here? #sxweartech
@manoushz - Dying to know how many people in #sxweartech audience own tech but aren't wearing it.
@manoushz - .@BradGriffith that leaves very little time for Glass! Seems like it's headed for niche use. Not life. #sxweartech
@manoushz - RT @gregswan: I've heard the WhatsApp notification tone from someone's phone in every single panel this year. #SXSW
@manoushz - @BradGriffith so how often are you wearing it??
@manoushz - I got a Glass Explorer invite last week. Not sure if I'll accept. Can novelty trump price tag? #sxweartech #SXSW
@manoushz - RT @SamGregory: Wearable tech too vague a term for this panel - surely bigger difference is between "monitoring" self and "monitoring" othe¡­
@manoushz - RT @webjournalist: For the record, I wear @googleglass in the name of journalism innovation. I am developing @GlassJournalism ¡­ cool sh*t t¡­
@manoushz - Wearables yes, Glass no. So far today @pogue and @zseward have told me that do NOT think Glass will go mainstream. #sxweartech #sxsw
@manoushz - Only about 7% of audience wearing Glass at Glassholes panel. 100% interested in "wearables". #sxweartech #sxsw http://t.co/IefcLp3Vxs
@manoushz - @ClaraJeffery we were all in denial.
@manoushz - Happy birthday, @pogue. Thanks for hanging w/@newtechcity on your special day #SXSW http://t.co/0uAEVXoIAe
