(1) Use the Karate Club Data, at
http://www.ee.columbia.edu/~cylin/course/sca-14/dataset/zachary.zip.
Write programs to calculate these properties of each node:
Degree
Closeness Centrality
Betweenness Centrality
Clustering Coefficient
(2) Write a program to visualize this network, using the force-direct
algorithm. Save the individual steps from random positions as individual
files. Use the HTML/Javascript template at
http://www.ee.columbia.edu/~cylin/course/sca-14/vistemplate.html
(3) Randomly select a person's id. Use Twitter API
https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1/get/followers/ids to get the follower
ids. Keep getting followers of some of this person's followers. Get a
graph of about 1000 people. Repeat the works in (1) and (2).
